# Binary_Search_Tree
This Code contains every Functions done on a binary search tree which will make it easy to understand.
#Case 1
  This case is used for insertion of a node at right place so that the tree remains binanry search tree.
#Case 2
  This case is used for Deletion of node which is leaf or between the tree without disturbing the binary search tree.
#case 3
  This case uses Iterative Method to search for a key in the tree
#Case 4
  This case uses recursive Methid to search for a key in the tree
#case 5
  This case shows pre order representation of the tree(root->left ->right)
#case 6
  This case shows post order representation of the tree(left ->right->root)
#case 7
  This case shows in order representation of the tree(left->root ->right)
#case 8
  This case if the tree is binary search tree or not
#case 9
  This case leave the system
